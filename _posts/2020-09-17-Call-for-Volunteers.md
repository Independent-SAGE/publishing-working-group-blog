## Open video call

There will be an open video call on [Jitsi](https://meet.jit.si/iSTPWG) at 17 Sept. 17:00 UTC if you want to find out more about the working group.

## Our workflows and publishing ethos

All software is free and open source, all content open licenced, and we use Open Science practices: open data, open methods, open standards, open learning, and inclusiveness.

For publishing technology we are platform independent (agnostic) and instead use open interoperable formats and transformations: XML, JATS, BITS, [MECA](https://www.niso.org/publications/rp-30-2020-meca), [PubFair](https://www.coar-repositories.org/news-updates/pubfair-version-2-now-available/) COAR, W3C standards., PIDs, off-piste Markdown, and even Blockchain (yes we found a use for it --- time stamps!).
