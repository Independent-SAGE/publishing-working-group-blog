Thank you and welcome to our supporting open-source partners.

The two organisations and their development communities have kindly agreed to lend support to the working group.

**Fidus Writer** is a European open-source company who produce the academic real-time collaborative authoring package 'Fidus Writer'. Already they have helped by adding Europe PMC citations to the authoring software. See: [https://www.fiduswriter.org/](https://www.fiduswriter.org/).

**Vivliostyle** is a Japanese non-profit organisation that maintains the CSS Typesetting open-source software Vivliostyle. See: [https://vivliostyle.org/](https://vivliostyle.org/). We use Vivliostyle to convert Fidus Writer documents into a Web Book, Screen PDF, and print-on-demand PDF.
